# How to use
- Right click Ethernet.bat and press edit
- Change "C:\Users\Eslorex\Desktop" to your desktop or whatever the connection.py path is.
- As Default it toggles the network adapter "Ethernet" but if you use a different adapter name just edit it in the code. (Here def toggle_network_connection(interface_name="Ethernet")) 
- Now you can run Ethernet.bat and ready to go.
- Default hotkey is SHIFT + X
- Pressing Escape will stop the script
